Challenge – Logistics company

Jack owns a logistics company, and he needs help building his platform to manage storage, inventory and transportation(shipments) of his packages. Your app should be able to complete the following tasks:

·  Register a new package into the system, assign a storage location from the warehouse to each package (unique locations, but if a package leaves the warehouse that location can once again be assigned to a package)

·  Listing of all packages in the system and their status (inventory of packages)

·  Ship a package. You have one truck to deliver packages, so you need to figure out the best route to deliver your packages. 

·  Map screen showing the shipping route with all the stops for delivery

·  Build the Back End using NodeJS

·  Build the Front End using ReactJS
